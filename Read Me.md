Redenbacher Deluxe
==================
Redenbacher Deluxe is a server-side mod for Planetary Annihilation. It promotes frenetic, massive wars by increasing build speed by a factor of 10. 

However, mexes still build at normal speed. This retains their importance to the game. 
AI Tweaks
---------
There's a UI mod called "Redenbacher AI Tweaks," available on PAMM, which is *required* if you intend to play AI Skirmishes with Redenbacher. Otherwise, expect a really dumb opponent with the stock AI.

Details
-------
Mexes produce 5x more metal to offset the speed demand. So do jigs.

All builders (factories, commanders, fabbers) build 10x their normal speed.

Commanders get a huge health boost (100,000), and it requires a medium army to take him down, or *a lot* of nukes. This may change in the future.

All other mechanics are the same, such as armor, damage, and move speed.

Future Considerations
---------------------
Catalysts and Haleys still build fast. I may change this because they are "Game Over" weapons, which do not have a counter.

Nukes still build fast! So do anti-nukes. This probably won't change.

Energy has to be tweaked, as it's a little too easy ATM.

I'm still wringing my hands over how much health to give the commander.

Hey

This is not a balance mod. It's a *fun* mod. Have fun!
